Professional, interactive data visualization for WordPress. Create stunning charts with a live-preview editor, CSV support, and manual data entry.

== Description ==

DearCharts is a powerful yet simple WordPress plugin that allows you to create and manage professional charts using a custom post type interface. Featuring a modern, split-screen admin UI, you can see your changes in real-time as you configure your data and styling.

= Key Features =
* **Live Preview Engine**: See your chart update instantly as you change data or settings.
* **Dual Data Sources**: Import data directly via CSV URL or enter it manually in a professional spreadsheet-like table.
* **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports Pie, Doughnut, Bar, and Line charts out of the box.
* **Responsive Design**: Charts are automatically responsive and look great on all devices.
* **Aesthetic Customization**: Choose from curated color palettes (Pastel, Ocean, Sunset, Neon, Forest) and customize axes and legends.
* **Shortcode Integration**: Easily embed charts anywhere using the generated [dearchart id="XX"] shortcode.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `dearcharts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the 'DearCharts' menu in your dashboard to start creating charts.
4. Add a new chart, configure your data, and copy the provided shortcode into any page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display a chart on my site? =
After publishing a chart, a shortcode like `[dearchart id="123"]` will be provided in the 'Chart Shortcodes' sidebar. Copy and paste this shortcode into any page, post, or widget area.

= Can I import data from Excel? =
Yes! Save your Excel sheet as a CSV file, upload it to your Media Library, and paste the URL into the 'Import from CSV' field in the plugin editor.

= Are the charts mobile-friendly? =
Absolutely. The charts use Chart.js which is responsive by default, and the plugin ensures they fit perfectly within their containers.
